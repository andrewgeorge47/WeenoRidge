# Measured: Science in the Open

Science engagement that meets communities where they are.

## Innovation Mobile Lab

The Innovation Mobile Lab name and program were created and are operated by Weeno Ridge LLC to bring hands-on science directly into communities. The physical mobile lab vehicle was commissioned and funded by United Way of Franklin County, with Weeno Ridge designing and delivering all educational programming, community partnerships, and outreach under the Innovation Lab brand.

Weeno Ridge continues to steward the Innovation Mobile Lab identity and its mission to create trust-building, curiosity-driven science access at a neighborhood level.
